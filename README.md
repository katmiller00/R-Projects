# R-Projects Repository
Hi there! Welcome to my repository for two distinct R projects focused on statistical analysis using multiple regression techniques. Below, youâ€™ll find brief summaries of each project, along with links to their detailed READMEs. These projects were both completed in economic courses at California State University, Fullerton.

## Project 1: Multiple Regression Analysis - Impact of Energy Assistance Programs on Low-Income Households
**Objective:** Examine the relationship between energy assistance programs and household income levels.

**Summary:** This project investigates whether households with lower income levels are more likely to participate in energy assistance programs, using data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2020. The analysis controls for variables such as household size, employment status, and race. The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between energy assistance participation and lower income levels, suggesting that these programs are effectively targeted towards low-income households.

## Project 2: Multiple Regression Analysis - Sleep Duration and Depression Frequency
**Objective:** Examine the relationship between sleep duration and depression.

**Summary:** This project investigates whether individuals who sleep fewer hours are more likely to experience depression, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The analysis controls for variables such as computer time, hours worked per week, and salary wages. The findings indicate a weak negative relationship between sleep duration and depression frequency, suggesting that insufficient sleep is associated with a higher likelihood of depression.
