# Multiple Regression Analysis - Sleep Duration and Depression Frequency
- **Objective:** Examine the relationship between sleep duration and depression.

- **Data Source:** National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).

- **Findings:** Weak negative relationship; less sleep correlates with higher depression.

- **Additional Factors:** Considered computer time, hours worked, and wages; minimal impact on depression.

- **Conclusion:** Emphasizes the importance of healthy sleep habits in reducing depression risk.

This project was conducted for an Econ 340 Economic Research Methods course at California State University, Fullerton.

## General Information
- This project investigates the relationship between sleep duration and depression frequency using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). We analyzed whether individuals who sleep fewer hours are more likely to experience depression, controlling for variables such as computer time, hours worked per week, and salary wages. Our findings indicate a weak negative relationship between sleep duration and depression frequency, suggesting that insufficient sleep is associated with a higher likelihood of depression. However, the influence of each variable on depression is minimal, highlighting the need for further research to consider additional factors like genetic predisposition, social support, and lifestyle. The results emphasize the importance of promoting healthy sleep habits to potentially reduce depression risk.


## Technologies Used

  - tidyverse package version 2.0.0
  - stargazer package version 5.2.3
  - dplyr package version 1.1.4
  - ggplot2 package version 3.5.1


## Features
List the ready features here:
- **Analysis of Sleep Duration and Depression Frequency:** Investigated the relationship between sleep duration and depression frequency using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).
- **Controlled Variables:** Considered additional factors such as computer time, hours worked per week, and salary wages to better understand their impact on depression.
- **Regression Analysis:** Utilized multiple regression analysis techniques to explore the relationship between sleep duration and depression while accounting for other variables.
- **Findings Interpretation:** Interpreted the results to highlight the implications for promoting healthy sleep habits and potentially reducing depression risk.
